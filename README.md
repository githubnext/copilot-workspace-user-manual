# ðŸ“– Copilot Workspace User Manual

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ This is the user manual for Copilot Workspace, an experiment by [GitHub Next](https://githubnext.com). Copilot Workspace is an AI-native dev environment that allows you to collaborate with Copilot on repo-wide coding tasks, using natural language and integrated cloud compute. You can learn more about what Copilot Workspace is from its [project page](https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-workspace/).

This manual will help you understand how to use Copilot Workspace most effectively, and share tips & tricks that we've learned while using Copilot Workspace to build Copilot Workspace. It also documents some known issues (it's an experiment after all!), as well the technical roadmap and origins of the project.
