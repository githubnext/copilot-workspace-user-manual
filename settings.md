# Copilot Workspace Settings

These settings are preferences for how you want Copilot Workspace to behave with your workflows.

## Automatically include external URLs in context

When this setting is enabled, Copilot Workspace will automatically include external URLs referenced in the task description as part of the context. This helps provide more relevant information and improve the accuracy of the generated specifications and plans.

## Collapse timeline on implement

When this setting is enabled, the timeline panel on the left side of the workspace will automatically collapse after you click the "Implement" button. This allows you to focus more on the code changes and less on the timeline, while still being able to revise with natural language.

## Show notification after long-running operations

When this setting is enabled, Copilot Workspace will notify you when it has completed long-running operations, such as implementing a plan. This allows you to get back into the flow as soon as possible, without having to constantly check the status of the operation. You can enable or disable this setting based on your preference.

## Spin up a codespace when a session is created

When this setting is enabled, a Codespace will be automatically created when you start a new session. This provides a full development environment with language services, making it easier to work on your tasks. Note that selecting this option may cause code generated by Copilot Workspace to be executed before you are able to review it. By selecting this, you acknowledge the risks of auto-running AI-generated code.

## Mark sessions as complete after committing

When this setting is enabled, Copilot Workspace will automatically mark sessions as complete after you create a PR, branch, or commit for them. This helps keep your recent sessions list clean and organized. If you later decide that you need to continue a session that was marked as complete, you can always resume it from the Completed sessions list at any time.

## Enable high contrast mode

When this setting is enabled, Copilot Workspace will use a high contrast color theme, making it easier to read and navigate the interface for users with visual impairments or those who prefer a higher contrast display.

## Open in VS Code Insiders

When this setting is enabled, the "Open in VS Code" button will launch VS Code Insiders instead of the stable version. This allows you to use the latest features and improvements available in the Insiders build of VS Code.
